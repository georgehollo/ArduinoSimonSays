Simon Says game using Arduino Hardware (4 LEDs, Joystick, Resistors)

I recently missed a project in which we had to code a Simon Says game using a DAQ simulator in one of my university courses.
I found this project very interesting and have also been trying to learn Arduino a lot better so I thought this would be a good chance to improve my skills.

 * Purpose: A simon says  game using arduino hardware. 4 LEDs
 * are set up to flash in a specicific randomized pattern. The user
 * then has to enter the sequence correctly (using the joystick) to
 * pass onto the next level. If the user gets the sequence wrong all
 * LEDs start flashing and the game is over. As you progress through
 * the levels the pattern gets longer and is showed for a shorter time.
