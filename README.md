 * Purpose: A simon says  game using arduino hardware. 4 LEDs
 * are set up to flash in a specicific randomized pattern. The user
 * then has to enter the sequence correctly (using the joystick) to
 * pass onto the next level. If the user gets the sequence wrong all
 * LEDs start flashing and the game is over. As you progress through
 * the levels the pattern gets longer and is showed for a shorter time.
